### Information Security

The CIA Triad of security attributes/goals.

* __Confidentiality__
An Information must not be available or be disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities or processes.
* __Integrity__
Accuracy and completeness of an information must be assured over its lifetime.
* __Availability__
An Information must be avaiblabe when needed.

### More Information Security

Secondary/derived security attributes/goals

* __Authenticity__
Correctness/Trustworthiness can be verified*.
* __Non Repudiation__
Operations cannot be denied by any party.
* __Accountability__
Operators can be clearly identified.
* __Anonymity__
Operators cannot be identified.

_*FYI: The term **Verification** implies proovability, this demands more than just a simple review which would be just **Validation**._

### Even More Informatin Security

GDPR (DSGVO) security attributes/goals

* __Resilience__
Robustness against surveillance and sabotage.

More or less a combination of all others because... EU lawyers, i guess...
